All improvements are aimed to be applicable or adaptable to other 3D printers

Wherever possible upgrades should support the open source community in not buying clones, but supporting original inventors
That is how we keep opensource alive.

Safety (confirmed thermal protection)
Printer reliability (set it and forget it)
Print speed (while maintaining quality)
Print quality
